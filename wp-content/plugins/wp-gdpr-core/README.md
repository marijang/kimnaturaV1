**Description**
This plugin will create a page where users can request access to their personal data, stored on your website.
In the backend you'll get an overview of the requests users send and you can see which plugins collect personal data and need a 'ask for approval' checkbox.
     
Users who ask to view their personal data will get an email with a unique url on which they can view their comments and ask for a removal per comment.
When they ask for a removal, the admin has the ability to delete or anonymize the comment through the wp-gdpr backend.
All emails will be sent automatically.
